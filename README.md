# Exp Date Detection Model
Welcome to the Exp Date Detection repository! This project aims to detect expiration dates on images using the Object Detection VGG16 model. We have also integrated the Cloud Vision service to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the bounding boxes generated by the VGG16 model.

*How It Works
Object Detection using VGG16:

We have trained an Object Detection model using the VGG16 architecture. This model can detect and draw bounding boxes around areas where expiration dates may be located.
*OCR with Cloud Vision:

After obtaining the bounding boxes from the VGG16 model, we use the Cloud Vision service to perform OCR on the text within them. This helps us extract text, including expiration dates, from the images.
