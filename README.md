<!-- Description about the Project -->
<p align="center">
  Indonesia confronts a pressing dilemma as one of the world's top food waste generators, discarding 20.94 million metric tons of food from households in 2020, equivalent to 37% of its total food production. Simultaneously, the nation grapples with severe food security issues, with approximately 7.9% of the population (nearly 20.3 million people) enduring malnourishment, accompanied by high rates of stunting (29.6%) and wasting (9.5%). To address these intertwined challenges, our project envisions a solution that connects surplus food from restaurants and supermarkets to low-income communities. This initiative aims to curb the volume of food destined for landfills while expanding access to nutritious and affordable food for those affected by food insecurity.
